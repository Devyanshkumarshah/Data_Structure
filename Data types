Reserved Keywords

auto   -   is a storage class specifier.
int    -   is a datatype
double   - datatype
struct   -    a container that can hold various items. Each item within the container has a specific type, and you can access these items using their names.
break   -   allows you to prematurely exit a loop (such as a for, while, or do-while loop) before its normal termination condition is met.
else   -  conditional statement
long    -   datatype
switch   -  Conditional statement
case  -  Inside the switch block, you use case labels to specify constant values.
enum 
register  -  The register keyword in C is a storage class specifier that suggests to the compiler that a variable should be stored in a CPU register.
typedef    
char    -  a datatype
extern   -   extern variables typically have global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
return  -  The return keyword is used to specify the value that the function will send back.
union   -   The primary purpose of a union is to save memory. Instead of allocating separate memory for each member, like a struct does, a union allocates only enough memory to hold its largest member.
continue  -   Its purpose is to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration.
for   -   loop
signed
void   -   When used as a function's return type, void indicates that the function does not return any value.
do  -  loop
if  -  conditional statement
static   -   This means the function is only accessible within the source file in which it's defined.
while   -   loop
default
goto  -  In situations with deeply nested loops, goto can provide a straightforward way to exit all loops at once.
sizeof   -   used to find size of variable
volatile   
const
float  -  datatype
short  
unsigned
